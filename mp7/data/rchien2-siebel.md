Ryan walks to Siebel to work on mp6. As a result of the heavy rain from earlier in the day, the sidewalks are very icy and look rather dangerous to walk on. Ryan has one of two options: to walk on the icy sidewalk or on the streets.

# rchien2-sidewalk
Ryan decides to throw caution to the wind and continues to walk on the icy sidewalk.

# rchien2-street
Ryan decides to avoid the icy sidewalks and walks on the streets.
